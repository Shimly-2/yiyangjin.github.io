short_bio: >-
  I am Yiyang Jin, a Master’s student at Tongji University, where I conduct research in Robotics under the supervision of Prof. Yanmin Zhou. My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Control Science and Engineering from Tongji University, and I am now deeply engaged in the field of reinforcement learning and robotics. My research interests lie in several cutting-edge areas, including 1) Reinforcement Learning, 2) Multimodal Learning, 3) Vision-Language-Action Model, 4) Foundation Models, and 5) Causal Inference. These topics are at the forefront of AI research and hold great potential for robotics. I am particularly interested in collaborating with researchers from diverse fields to drive innovation and address complex challenges. If you share similar interests or have opportunities to discuss, I would be thrilled to connect with you.
