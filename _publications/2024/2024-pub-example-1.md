  Human tactile perception enables rapid assessment of deformable objects and the application of appropriate force to prevent slip or excessive deformation. However, this task remains challenging for robots. To address this issue, we propose the T-TD3 algorithm, which utilizes a multi-scale fusion neural network (MSF-Net) for the fused perception of multiscale features, including the tactile prior information obtained through preprocessing. Our approach decomposes the robot task of grasping deformable objects into three subtasks: slip detection, stable grasping evaluation, and minimum grasping force tracking. We develop a simulation environment called CR5GraspStable- Env using PyBullet and TACTO for the network training. Our work reports a success rate of 94.81% in the robot task of grasping deformable objects in real, demonstrating an excellent sim-to-real capability. Moreover, the proposed approach has the potential to be extended to other stable grasping tasks that utilize tactile perception.
