  Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) provides a new idea for harvesting low-frequency energy tire-road interaction and self-powered sensors. A real-time assessment of skid resistance provides valuable information to deliver appropriate driving manner to ensure safety in all weather conditions. However, there is no mature perception technology in the previous study due to the complexity of tire-road interaction. Inventing appropriate devices and solutions for harvesting wasted energy and obtaining skid resistance information in real-time is essential. Here, a textile-inspired TENG is developed, which was integrated into the tire cord for energy harvesting and self-powered skid resistance monitoring. As the theoretical basis, the capability of the proposed textile-inspired TENG for energy harvesting and skid-resistance monitoring was demonstrated based on the coupling of vehicle-road dynamics and the electrodynamics. Consequently, the average power density reaches to 4.219 mW/m2(output power with 82.7 μW). Besides, the short-circuit current waveform of the intelligent tires was firstly applied to distinguish the difference of the pavement skid resistance caused by the roughness characteristics of the pavement structure. The open-circuit voltage amplitude was adopted to evaluate the correlation quantitatively between pavement skid resistance and the TENG's output signal, and the accuracy of this system can reach 96%. This work innovatively proposes a new idea for simultaneously harvesting wasted energy from tire-road interaction and improving the level of traffic safety and expands the application of triboelectric nanogenerators for automatic driving technology.
